We are using Mocha, a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. 
Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases.
https://mochajs.org/

Already set up a test script in package.json
"scripts": { "test": "mocha --timeout 5000" }

-t, --timeout <ms>
Specifies the test-case timeout, defaulting to 2 seconds. To override you may pass the timeout in milliseconds, or a value with the s suffix,
ex: --timeout 2s or --timeout 2000 would be equivalent.


Then run tests with
$ cd ../MOEA-SmartFactory/sfDeviceLib/NodejsSDK
$ npm test
